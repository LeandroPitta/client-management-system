2. Install dependencies: express, sqlite3, cors, dotenv, helmet, morgan
3. Install dev dependencies: nodemon, concurrently
4. Create basic folder structure following MVC pattern
5. Set up package.json scripts for development

Expected folder structure:
- src/controllers/
- src/models/
- src/routes/
- src/middleware/
- src/database/
- src/utils/

Create basic server.js file that starts Express server on port 3001.
```

   - phone (VARCHAR(20))
   - address (TEXT)
   - city (VARCHAR(50))
   - state (VARCHAR(50))
   - zip_code (VARCHAR(10))
   - created_at (DATETIME, DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
   - updated_at (DATETIME, DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)

3. Create migration script to initialize database

5. Add proper error handling and connection management

Make sure to follow SQLite best practices and handle database errors gracefully.
```
